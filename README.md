# readme-generator

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application that generates a professional README, based on user input. Once the node index.js command is ran, the user is prompted with a series of questions to fill out a README file. After all the prompts are answered, the file is generated in the folder named generated.

## Installation
To be able to use this app, Node.js must be installed. If the user doesn't have a package.json file, run the npm init to create one. Then the inquirer package must be installed (npm i inquier).

## Usage
Here is a link to the video tutorial of the readme generator. [ReadMe generator tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Hj2TGWn8clz9ccF4mcg7LEm-b9w0Zfh/view?usp=sharing)

Once the required packages are installed, the user needs to open the intergrated terminal for the index.js. Next run the command node.js index.js to begin the application. Answer all of the prompts and then a readme with the information provided will be genereated and placed in the generated folder.
